# COVID-19 WHO Situation Reports Importer

This python notebook fetches [situation reports on the Covid-19 outbreak from the World Health Organisation](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports) and renders the data tables as Pandas Dataframes using the [Parsr project](https://github.com/axa-group/Parsr)'s [python client](https://github.com/axa-group/Parsr/blob/master/demo/jupyter-notebook/parsr_client.py).

Feel free to use it as a launchpad for any further analysis that would help your visualisations/projects of the currently ongoing pandemic.
